*Verse 1:
Listen up, I got a secret to share
A password that's so rare, it's beyond compare
It's the key to the underground, the place to be
But you gotta keep it hush, don't let it leak

Chorus:
Underground, underground, that's the word
The password that'll get you in, haven't you heard?
Keep it safe, keep it tight, don't let it slip
Underground, underground, that's the tip

Verse 2:
It's a secret society, a hidden world
Where the cool kids hang, and the beats unfurl
But you gotta know the code, gotta be in the know
So listen up, here's the password, let it flow

Chorus:
Underground, underground, that's the word
The password that'll get you in, haven't you heard?
Keep it safe, keep it tight, don't let it slip
Underground, underground, that's the tip

Verse 3:
So if you wanna be down, if you wanna be in
If you wanna be part of the scene, let the password begin
It's a secret handshake, a nod and a wink
But remember, keep it quiet, don't let it sink

Chorus:
Underground, underground, that's the word
The password that'll get you in, haven't you heard?
Keep it safe, keep it tight, don't let it slip
Underground, underground, that's the tip

Outro:
So there you have it, the password's out
But remember, keep it safe, don't let it shout
Underground, underground, that's the place to be
And with the password in hand, you'll be part of the elite.*
